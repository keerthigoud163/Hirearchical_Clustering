# Hirearchical_Clustering

# Project Title:
Analysis and prediction of "Mall_Customers.csv" of American mall market called as phonix mall,find out on the basis of clients requirements and dendrogram using scipy graphic library with the help of "scipy.cluster.hieracy",to ace the no.of linkage of a clustering to predict.

# Problem Statement:
The american finance market clients as per the rate of GDP of 2011 found as no.of growth in their business market.
As data science enginner find out which hierachy cluster gives maximum linkage in upcoming future.

# Task 1:
With the help of numpy library import the library and dataset.

# Task 2:
Using the dendrogram to find the optimum number of clusters.

# Task 3:
Create a hierachy model and visulaze the cluster with the cluster with the help of matplot library.

# Dendrogram:

# Conclusion:
According to the model building as enginner my prediction is cluster number 3 as give highest no.of linkage.

# Insights:
1.Cluster 1 contain(red) the color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucliding distance from the centroid up to annual income approximate 139ks.

2.Cluster 2 cotains(blue) which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucliding distance from the centroid up to annual income approximately 79-80ks.

3.Cluster 3 cotains(green) which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucliding distance from the centroid up to annual income approximately 139s.

4.Cluster 4 cotains(skyblue) which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucliding distance from the centroid up to annual income approximately 39-40s.

5.Cluster 2 cotains(pink) which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucliding distance from the centroid up to annual income approximately40-41s
